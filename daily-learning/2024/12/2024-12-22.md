    - Date
        - A Date value encapsulate a single point in time, independent of any particular calendrical system or time zone. Date values represent a time interval relative to an absolute reference date.
    - DateInterval
        - DateInterval represents a closed date interval in the form of [startDate, endDate]. It is possible for the start and end dates to be the same with a duration of 0. DateInterval does not support reverse intervals i.e. intervals where the duration is less than 0 and the end date occurs earlier in time than the start date.
    - TimeInterval
        - A TimeInterval value is always specified in seconds; it yields sub-millisecond precision over a range of 10,000 years.
